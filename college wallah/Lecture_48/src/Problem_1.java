// You have 'n'(n<=10^5) boxes of chocolate. Each of contains a[i] (a[i]<=10000) chocolate. you need to distribute these boxes among 'm' students such that the maximum number of chocolate allocated to a student is minimum.
// (a) One box will be allocated to exactly one student.
// (b) All the boxes should be allocated.
// (c) Each student has to be allocated at least one box.
// (d) Allotment should be in contiguous order, for instance, a student cannot be allocated box 1 and box 3,skipping box 2.
//
// Calculate and return that minimum possible number.
//
// Assume that it is always possible to distribute the chocolates.
//
// The first line of input will contain the value of n, the number of boxes.
// The second line of input will contain the n number denoting the number of chocolate in each box.
// The third line will contain the m, number of students.
